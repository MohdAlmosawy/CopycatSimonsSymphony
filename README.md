## Developer Guide

### Architecture

Copycat Simon's Symphony is a client-side web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It follows a single-page application (SPA) architecture, where different sections of the game are dynamically shown or hidden based on user interactions.

### Design Principles

The following design principles were followed during the development of Copycat Simon's Symphony:

1. **Modularity**: The code is organized into separate modules and components, each responsible for a specific functionality or feature of the game. This promotes code reusability and maintainability.

2. **Separation of Concerns**: The HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code are kept separate, following the best practices of front-end development. This allows for easier management and understanding of each layer.

### Key Algorithms

1. **Coloring the Game Title**: The coloring algorithm is responsible for dynamically styling the game title in the main menu. It applies different colors to each letter of the game title, creating an eye-catching visual effect.

2. **Playback Sequence**: The playback sequence algorithm visually and audibly plays back the generated sequence of button presses to the player. It utilizes timeouts to create delays between each button press, ensuring a clear and understandable pattern for the player to follow.

3. **User Input Validation**: The user input validation algorithm checks whether the user's input matches the generated sequence. It compares the user's input with the corresponding elements in the sequence array, ensuring accuracy and detecting any mistakes made by the player.

### Data Structures

1. **Game State**: The game state data structure keeps track of important information about the current state of the game, such as whether it is the player's turn, the current score, and the generated sequence. It allows for efficient management and manipulation of game-related data.

2. **Leaderboard**: The leaderboard data structure stores the top scores achieved by different players. It typically consists of an array of objects, where each object represents a player's username and score. The leaderboard is updated whenever a player achieves a high score and enters their username.


### Code Organization

The codebase is organized as follows:

- **index.html**: This is the main HTML file that contains the structure of the game's user interface. It includes links to external CSS and JavaScript files and defines the different screens and components of the game.

- **main.js**: This JavaScript file contains the logic for handling user interactions, generating random sequences, checking user input, and managing game state. It also includes functions for displaying screens, playing sounds, and handling form submissions.

- **style.css**: This CSS file defines the styles and layout of the game's user interface. It includes global styling, header styling, main menu styling, game play styling, score screen styling, scoreboard styling, and other relevant styles.

### Important Modules or Components

The following are important modules or components used in Copycat Simon's Symphony:

- **Header**: The header component contains the game's logo and high score display.

- **Main Menu**: The main menu component is responsible for displaying the game's title and a "Play" button. It handles the transition to the game play screen when the button is clicked.

- **Countdown Screen**: The countdown screen component displays a countdown animation before the game starts. It provides a visual cue to the player and creates anticipation.

- **Game Play Screen**: The game play screen component displays the circular buttons representing different colors. It manages the playback of the sequence and captures user input.

- **Score Screen**: The score screen component shows the current score and high score achieved by the player during the game. It appears after the player's turn ends.

- **Congratulations Screen**: The congratulations screen component appears when the player achieves a high score and allows them to enter their username for the leaderboard.

- **Scoreboard Screen**: The scoreboard screen component displays the top scores achieved by different players. It provides a leaderboard view and options to try the game again or share it.

These are the key aspects of the architecture, design principles, algorithms, data structures, code organization, and important modules or components used in Copycat Simon's Symphony. Understanding these will help you navigate and enhance the game's codebase effectively.
